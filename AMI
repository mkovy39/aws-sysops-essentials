Amazon Machine Image (AMI) Overview

An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) provides the information required to launch an instance in AWS. It includes the operating system, application server, applications, and configurations. By using AMIs, you can quickly create multiple instances with the same configuration.

AMI Types

AWS offers several types of AMIs to suit different use cases:

- Amazon-provided AMIs: Basic operating systems, often with AWS-optimized configurations.
- AWS Marketplace AMIs: Pre-packaged AMIs that include applications and services, available for purchase.
- Community AMIs: Created and shared by other users, often used for open-source applications.
- Custom AMIs: User-created AMIs that include custom applications, configurations, and data, which are specific to individual needs.

AMI Creation Process

Creating a custom AMI from an existing instance allows you to replicate the same configuration on new instances.

Steps to Create an AMI from an EC2 Instance

1. Go to the EC2 Console on AWS.
2. Select the Instance: Choose the instance you want to use to create the AMI.
3. Choose “Create Image”:
   - Right-click the instance or select Actions > Image and templates > Create Image.
4. Configure Image Options:
   - Enter an image name and description.
   - Configure storage options if needed.
5. Create Image: Click Create Image to start the process.

Once the image creation is complete, your AMI will be available in the AMI section of the EC2 Console.

AMI No-Reboot Option

The No-Reboot option allows you to create an AMI without rebooting the instance. This can be useful for minimizing downtime but may result in data inconsistency if there are ongoing operations.

How to Use the No-Reboot Option

1. Follow the steps for creating an AMI as described above.
2. When configuring the AMI options, check the No Reboot option.
3. Proceed with the image creation.

Note: AWS does not guarantee the integrity of the AMI if the instance is not rebooted, so only use this option when necessary.

Launching an Instance from an AMI

Once you have an AMI, you can launch new instances with the exact configuration of the original instance.

Steps to Launch an Instance from an AMI

1. Go to the EC2 Console and navigate to AMIs.
2. Select the AMI: Choose the AMI you want to use.
3. Click Launch: This will take you to the instance configuration page.
4. Configure Instance Settings: Choose instance type, network, storage, security groups, and any other configurations needed.
5. Launch the Instance.
