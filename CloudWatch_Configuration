Step 1: Create an IAM Role for CloudWatch

1. Go to the IAM Console on AWS.
2. Select Roles from the left menu and click Create Role.
3. Choose AWS Service as the trusted entity, and select EC2 as the use case for the role.
4. Click Next and attach the policy named CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy.
   - This policy allows the EC2 instance to send metrics and logs to CloudWatch.
5. Complete the role creation and name it something like CloudWatchAgentRole.

Step 2: Launch an EC2 Instance and Attach the IAM Role

1. Go to the EC2 Console and click Launch Instance.
2. Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI), such as Amazon Linux 2 AMI.
3. Select an instance type, like t2.micro (free-tier eligible).
4. In the Configure Instance step, attach the IAM role you created (CloudWatchAgentRole).
5. Complete the instance setup and launch the instance.

Step 3: Connect to the EC2 Instance

1. Connect to your EC2 instance using SSH from your terminal.
   
   ssh -i /path/to/your-key.pem ec2-user@<public-ip-address>
   

 Step 4: Install Apache HTTP Server and Configure Web Page

1. Switch to the root user to execute commands as a superuser:
   
   sudo su
   

2. Install Apache HTTP server (httpd):
   
   yum install httpd -y
   

3. Create a simple HTML page that says "Hello World!":
   
   echo 'hello world!' > /var/www/html/index.html
   

4. Start the Apache HTTP server:
   
   systemctl start httpd
   

5. Enable Apache HTTP server to start on boot:
   
   systemctl enable httpd
   

6. View the Apache HTTP server’s access log:
   
   cat /var/log/httpd/access_log
   

7. View the Apache HTTP server’s error log:
   
   cat /var/log/httpd/error_log
   

Step 5: Install and Configure CloudWatch Agent

1. Install the CloudWatch Agent on your instance:
   
   sudo yum install amazon-cloudwatch-agent -y
   

2. Configure the CloudWatch Agent to send logs to CloudWatch:
   - Run the configuration wizard to generate a configuration file:
     
     sudo /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-config-wizard
     
   - This wizard will guide you through setting up metrics and log paths. Specify the log paths (/var/log/httpd/access_log and /var/log/httpd/error_log) when prompted.

3. Fetch the CloudWatch Agent configuration and start the agent:
   
   sudo /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl -a fetch-config -m ec2 -c ssm:AmazonCloudWatch-linux -s
   

   - -a fetch-config: Fetches the agent configuration.
   - -m ec2: Specifies that this configuration is for an EC2 instance.
   - -c ssm:AmazonCloudWatch-linux: Refers to the Systems Manager (SSM) parameter name that contains the configuration.
   - -s: Starts the agent with the fetched configuration.
